# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

For speed, the front end was created on Repl.it. On the website, you can "wave" to me, which includes incrementing the amount of waves by 1 and sending a custom message along with the wave. All of the waves of previous users can be seen on the frontend.
